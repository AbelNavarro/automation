## Whitelist of files and symlinks for which it is either acceptable
## to be added to /usr, or which need to be fixed so that they are
## no longer added.
##
## Symlinks can be optionally whitelisted only if they point to
## a given destination, via the format:
##
##    /path/to/symlink -> /other/path/to/symlink/target
##
## It's just a substring match, so either side can be omitted.
##
## Comments and blank lines are stripped from this file before
## usage.
